# NFT Marketplace Frontend
A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplace is a digital platform where individuals can buy, sell, and trade NFTs. NFTs are unique, indivisible tokens that represent ownership of a specific digital or physical asset, such as digital art, music, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more.  

This Code created using Next.js provides a beautiful frontend for creating NFT Marketplace. It can be seamlessly integrated on any Smart contract to create a fully working NFT marketplace.
